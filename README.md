# Satellite Data

This is a script for collecting satellite data (including elevation data) for this project.

## Dependencies

You will need to get a free [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key. The script expects there is a `data` directory in the root folder, and a raw text `token` file containing the mapbox API key.


## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sunkcosts/satellite-data.git
cd satellite-data
python mapbox.py
```
