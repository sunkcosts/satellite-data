# Satellite Data

This is a collection of scripts and notebooks for collecting satellite data for this project.

## Dependencies

You will need to get a free [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key to run these scripts. The scripts expect there is a `data` directory in the root folder, and a  `credentials` directory with a `mapbox-token.json` file in the following format.

```json
{
  "access-token": "<your token here>"
}
```
